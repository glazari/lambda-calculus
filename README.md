# Lambda Calculus

This repo is my attempt to implement the lambda calculus in Rust.
Trying to follow the book "Types and Programming Languages" by Benjamin C. Pierce.


# Untyped Arithmetic Expressions


## Grammar

```

term ::= true
       | false 
       | if term then term else term 
       | 0
       | succ term
       | pred term
       | iszero term

```

example REPL output:

```
Lambda REPL
> if iszero succ 0 then true else false
If(IsZero(Succ(Zero)), True, False)
consts: {"true", "false", "0"}
size: 6
depth: 4

> pred pred succ 0
Pred(Pred(Succ(Zero)))
consts: {"0"}
size: 4
depth: 4

>
```

# Untyped Lambda Calculus

## Grammar

```
term ::= x
       | Î»x. term
       | \x. term
       | term term
```


# Lisp


## Grammar

```
term ::= expression | fundef
fundef ::= "(" "define" "(" function arglist ")" expression ")"
arglist ::= "(" variable* ")"
expression ::= value
            | variable
            | "(" "if" expression expression expression ")"
            | "(" "define" variable expression ")"
            | "(" optr expression* ")"
            | "(" "lambda" arglist expression ")"
optr ::= function | value-op
value ::= number | quoted-const
quoted-const ::= "'"S-expr
S-expr ::= number | simbol | "(" S-expr* ")"
value-op := "+" 
        | "-" 
        | "*" 
        | "/" 
        | "<" 
        | ">"
        | "="
        | "print"
        | "cons"
        | "car"
        | "cdr"
        | "null?"
        | "number?"
        | "list?"
        | "eq?" 
function := identifier
variable := identifier
number := "-"? digit+
identifier := letter (letter | digit)*
